# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues on CSF site (calendar filter width, filter position, typography updates, Koch images page cleanup, initial Azure exploration), exploring GitHub

**Thoughts:** Made a little more UI progress on CSF; it's great to be able to make updates without having to relay on someone else's help. Excited to get more comfortable using GitHub. Looking forward to the challenge!

### Day 1: March 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished GitHub Desktop video, played around in GitHub a bunch, started doing some anime.js animations. Spent time exploring tools for writing code and having changes show uo in Live Preview. Landed on using Brackets for now but Sublime, Atom and Live Server seem like a good idea to look into. Also spent some time trying to get my arms around the fundamentals of svgs and canvas.

**Thoughts:** GitHub Desktop is still super confusing

### Day 2: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Put the anime test project in my GitHub repo(!!!), watched a video on anime.js, watched a video on an exciting new particle generator.

**Thoughts:** GitHub is a little less confusing but I should probably find a group project to join and play around. Need to solidify my goals for the 100 days. Was able to chain together some anime.js action in an intersting way (sequential color changes during an x tranform).

### Day 3: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mainly work on CSF, trying to untangle a server problem

**Thoughts:**  SiteGround is a great option for WordPress sites!

### Day 4: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I was hoping to spend time working on a particle generator project. Instead I got sucked down the rabbit hole of node.js... Played around with node. Still unclear of all it can do but it seems live a great environment for testing sites.

**Thoughts:**  Node.js is a runtime environment, not a framework. Dusting off what I remember if Javascript. At some point I should find a Javascript challenge.

### Day 5: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  More reading about node.js and runtime environments. Hopefully before going to sleep I can watch another video or two on it.

**Thoughts:**  I should probably make an infographic about what I've learned about node. By tomorrow evening I'll have Live Server installed and begin exploring particles.js

### Day 6: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Investigated new hosting platform. Spent time poking around in the cPanel checking out what it offers.

**Thoughts:**  So many options of how to configur things...

### Day 7: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Exciting Saturday night. More looking into node.js and live-server. Spent time reviewing the particles.js set-up; looks like I'll need to do more work before testing the framework. Node installed!

**Thoughts:**  Definitely spend more time learning everything that node.js can do

### Day 8: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Deep dive into node packages. Some reading and watching videos on AE scripts and kinematic animations

**Thoughts:**  Node has some interesting possibilities but still not sure how to sew all the pieces together

### Day 9: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  CSS explorations and beginning round 3 with PHP. Saw some cool stuff in the latest CodePen email. I should probably try one of the challenges!

**Thoughts:**  Life is much easier when you can get under the hood. I wish PHP syntax was a little clearer. Created a custom child theme from scratch!

### Day 10: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Lots more cleanup and bug squashing. Got some interesting feedback today. Wish I was better at PHP...

**Thoughts:**  If I'm goin to be spending time in WP, you need PHP! Lots of terrible site hosting options out there.

### Day 11: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Let one of my domains expire and spent time looking into how to revive it (and what is was hosting anyway). More site nipping and tucking. Need to turn on spam blocker.

**Thoughts:**  Picking  ahost with great support is very important.

### Day 12: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Poking around at MailGun and Lottie. Started setting up CocoaPods without realising it was more for app development than website development. Along the way got a clean install of Ruby (including starting a Ruby tutorial). Ran into a really annoying problem with permissions in Node.

**Thoughts:**  It's always the tiniest problems that take up the most time.  

### Day 13: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  More Node work. Installed nvm. Finally worked around the permissions issue! Also figured out how to use live-server with active projects (navigate to the file being tested FIRST then run live-server)

**Thoughts:**   Sometimes the smallest bit of progress changes everything.

### Day 14: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Logging all the stuff I've been doing over the past 9 days.

**Thoughts:**  Yous should probably log along the way... (-_-)
