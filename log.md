# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues on CSF site (calendar filter width, filter position, typography updates, Koch images page cleanup, initial Azure exploration), exploring GitHub

**Thoughts:** Made a little more UI progress on CSF; it's great to be able to make updates without having to relay on someone else's help. Excited to get more comfortable using GitHub. Looking forward to the challenge!

### Day 1: March 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished GitHub Desktop video, played around in GitHub a bunch, started doing some anime.js animations. Spent time exploring tools for writing code and having changes show uo in Live Preview. Landed on using Brackets for now but Sublime, Atom and Live Server seem like a good idea to look into. Also spent some time trying to get my arms around the fundamentals of svgs and canvas.

**Thoughts:** GitHub Desktop is still super confusing

### Day 2: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Put the anime test project in my GitHub repo(!!!), watched a video on anime.js, watched a video on an exiting new particle generator.

**Thoughts:** GitHub is a little less confusing but I should probably find a group project to join and play around. Need to solidify my goals for the 100 days. Was able to chain together some anime.js action in an intersting way (sequential color changes during an x tranform).
